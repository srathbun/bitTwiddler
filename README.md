bitTwiddler
===========

bitTwiddler shows what happens when two numbers are bit shifted, using the python curses module. I wanted to have a visual representation handy, and play with the curses module at the same time.

See [this blog](http://www.catonmat.net/blog/low-level-bit-hacks-you-absolutely-must-know/) post for some cool uses of bit twiddling.
